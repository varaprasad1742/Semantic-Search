And she’s one of the highest priestesses of the church that serves her.
If there is one of her in the country, it is said to be a safe existence, but for some reason, she is in this remote region.
From an outsider’s point of view, it’s a bizarre sight. The surrounding aristocrats won’t stay quiet.
One day, Julis and Cecilia were told by their father, the lord of the frontier, 
“You two are going to attend the magic academy.”
“……I, can’t use magic, though?”
This is the story of Julis, who can’t use magic but is enrolled in the magic academy, and Cecilia a Saintess, who is the highest priestess, who are involved in various events at the academy!

She’s the Older Sister of the Yandere Male Lead In a BL Novel,"In this life, I was born with a gold spoon in my mouth. I thought my future would be bright.As a matter of fact, I didn’t realize that the place I reincarnated into was a discontinued R-19 tragic BL novel that my friend wrote.
And of all things, I became the older twin sister of Lisandro, the crazy obsessive yandere male lead who horribly, brutally murdered the sickly prisoner Frey at the end of the novel.
If I didn’t remember this, I would have just jumped into the sunset, blissfully unaware…
***
“Noona.”
With a suitcase in one hand, I flinched and looked behind me. The mysteriously beautiful Frey came towards me with a bright smile on his lips.
In no time, he towered over me with his tall, lean body.
“Where are you going?”
“Um.”
“Where?”
Don’t ask.
I wanted to say this firmly, but I just wore a smile instead. Frey, who kept staring me, tried to grab my suitcase.
Taken aback, I held onto it tightly. In return, I heard a refreshing, clear laugh.
“Let me hold it for you.”
“No, I’m fine.”
“Why? Oh, I get it. You’re trying to escape. Am I getting in your way?”
The hand holding the suitcase flinched. As he looked at me with an eerie smile, he looked exceedingly dangerous the more he stared. There was ice glistening behind his golden irises.
“You thought I wouldn’t know.”
His large hand wrapped around mine and held the suitcase handle tightly.
“Just to avoid me and that bastard, you’re trying to run away.”
His harsh words didn’t match his aloof expression.
“It’ll spell trouble, Yuni. If you disappear from my sight.”
The gentle and feeble, sickly prisoner suddenly became an obsessive yandere himself.","['Adult', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Mature', 'Romance', 'Smut']",https://www.novelupdates.com/series/shes-the-older-sister-of-the-yandere-male-lead-in-a-bl-novel/

Taming the Dark Lord,"One day on the street, Amelia saved the life of an adorable dark elf who was already on the verge of death and was barely breathing. The little guy had a pair of scarlet eyes, pointed ears and a honey-toned skin. He also bore a rebellious personality, clearly matching his brooding appearance.A stark contrast to her, however, he was a devout follower of the God of Darkness, a firm believer at that, too. The elf was grumpy and a menace, matched with his sharp teeth which promised nothing but pain. His mouth reeked of harsh, biting words and with his sharp tongue, he had insulted her kind by referring them as ‘lackeys of the light’.
Soon, Amelia had enough of it. Unable to control her rage any longer, reprimanded the elf and threatened the crouched form in front of her. “If you dare call me a ‘lackey’ again, don’t be surprised if I cut your pocket money off!”
One day, she opened a book. It’s been quite a while since she last read one. Her eyes skimmed the pages, letting herself be swept away completely.
[The God of Darkness was a sinister and mysterious evil spirit. He had pale hair, dark, age-looking skin and his eyes were the most scarlet pair of orbs ever seen…]
As she stumbled on such texts, she stopped reading. She straightened her back and lifted her head from the pages, and her eyes caught sight of the dark elf across her. The elf was diligently cleaning the space, too focused on his errand that he didn’t notice Amelia staring at him.
‘Pale hair, dark skin, and scarlet eyes.’ Amelia thought.
[He carried a mysterious golden totem on his back, which is shaped like a blade. Evil to the extreme in appearance…]
Repeating the lines from the book she just read, Amelia eyed the mark on the elf’s back.
[First and foremost, the God of Darkness had a brutal personality. If you dare violate His order, He would surely bestow your life with such cruelty that your soul will be ripped apart into smithereens, making your body nothing but a hollow shell that would soon be turned into ashes under his fingertips..]
Right at that second, the elf approached Amelia and arrogantly called out.
 “Hey lackey,” he said, his eyes drifting as if in a daze. “Where is the money you promised?”
Agitated by both the elf’s approach and the book in front of her, Amelia frustratingly tore the page off its’ ream. She was upset for having bought a book that had nothing but false, misleading information.

But Shixiong Doesn’t Want To Be A Villain!,"Bai Fanlu transmigrated into an immortal cultivation novel as a villainous demon lord.In the original novel, the demon lord was originally in the ranks of the immortal class and had a promising future. Unfortunately, he fell in love with the male lead, became a villain for his sake, and ended up with his soul disintegrated.
Bai Fanlu objected to this idiotic plot. The reason for the demon lord to become a villain was not the least justified. He was obviously a decent gentleman! The most important reason, of course, is that the demon lord and him share the same name.
System: [Giving you a chance to prove yourself.]
Bai Fanlu: [?]
System: [Persevere and do not become a villain to the end, and you can return home when the male lead is done with saving the world.]
Bai Fanlu: […What if I become a villain?]
System: [Then of course you will end up as cannon fodder.]
Bai Fanlu has a plan. In order to not become a villain, he has to adhere to three principles:
Do not have any physical contact with the main lead.
Do not have any grudge entanglement with the main lead.
Do not have any emotional interaction with the main lead.
However, nothing went as planned…
1. The first day Bai Fanlu escaped from the mountain, he was carried back to the Sect by the main lead in full view of everyone.
All the female disciples: “Sect Leader is so considerate to Shixiong.”
Bai Fanlu: “…”
2. When Bai Fanlu was about to go out of control with his cultivation, the male lead risked his life to unblock his meridians to keep him from harm.
All the male disciples: “Sect Leader was willing to sacrifice his life to save another, such a righteous man and deserving of our admiration.”
Bai Fanlu: “…”
3. The cliff below was an endless abyss, and according to the original plot, he will be pushed down into the 10,000-feet deep demon pit.
Bai Fanlu thought to himself, ‘Am I doomed to become a villain?’
As he was getting desperate, a figure descended from the sky, throwing out a long, colourful damask to him, snatching him out of the red lotus fire and carrying him up into the sky.
Under the divine tree, above the sea of clouds and mountains, the young man forcibly trapped him, with a darkness swirling in his eyes he said, “Shixiong…are you trying to leave me? I will not allow it.”
Bai Fanlu: “…”
Bai Fanlu: “So, who exactly is becoming the villain in the end?”","['Comedy', 'Shounen Ai']",https://www.novelupdates.com/series/but-shixiong-doesnt-want-to-be-a-villain/

He is loyal to his duties, but there is one thing he is even more passionate about – its his ambition to corrupt highborn women of his choice and build a harem for himself.
For that, the Elreis Magical Girls Academy is a suitable hunting ground. It is a garden of prideful women, but only the ladies of famous high-class families were able to attend there, and of course, where all boys were forbidden from entering.
It is to the extent that even the most bottom personnel are thoroughly selected and sieved for their abilities so that there won’t be a need for a single male in the school, but after corrupting the headmaster, Julia, into something that can’t live on without his member, he succeeded in infiltrating the school as their first male magic teacher.
As he is also a court wizard with a good reputation, he was well received by the noble ladies in the class. But even with all that adoration, he only plans to aim at the best of the best.
He entices several women in the academy; the students, the student council president, and the school’s teachers, and even the school nurse, achieving the ultimate pleasure by corrupting the innocence that these haughty women protect the most.
However, it is not without risks, as the more his women grew, the more the attention he gains from the powerful chancellor, which is also the founder of the school.
Will Theophil succeed in making his dream harem? Or will he fail and lose everything before he makes it to the top?
Making use of his body manipulation magic and mind-reading techniques, plus his wits as an excellent court wizard, Theophil’s plan to get the best girls for his harem as he outwits the chancellor has already begun!","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Shounen']",https://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-harem-teacher-at-elreis-sorceress-academy/

Because her engagement fell through, and her reputation was ruined, she was pressured to spill her own blood in the palace hall! Once again opening her eyes, the cowardice had vanished, replaced by coldness, causing others to be intimidated at first glance. Yet no one realized, she was not her.He, the current dynasty’s Chu Wang, served the country and brought peace and stability. Peerless and magnificent, all the girls under the Heavens eagerly pursued him! He helped her break off her engagement in the palace hall, but she avoided him at a great distance. He set his mind to pursue her, but she didn’t intend to love him.
At home, the turbulent currents of government affairs surged violently, disputes from every country continued to spring up everywhere. The stunning her who had been reborn, and how she didn’t bat an eyelid to resolve that terrifying carnage; her name had shaken the whole world!

Yet the one they could not provoke even more was his Wang Fei – Yun Qian Meng! Anyone who provoked Chu Wang Fei, must surely be prepared to lose their necks!
A breathtaking rebirth, a thrilling marriage, in the blink of an eye the once weak woman had become the honorable Chu Wang Fei!
Wang Fei: In the palace chambers, between the feasts, smiles are hiding daggers, with layers and layers of plots and machinations; those who hurt my flesh and blood will have to pay the price.
Chu Wang: In these troubled times, carrying the fire beacon, over thousands of miles of fortresses and mountains, I have traveled to the distance to these border stations; if you dare to hurt my wife I will take your life.

Chu Wang: Returning home, difficult problems arise. As green hills extend into the distance, beautiful flowers and tender feelings grow deeply; dealing with the ruler and his ministers is harder than rising into Heaven.

Song of Time – Dusk Awakening Verse,"The events in Varlhun (维尔哈伦) are set in an urban fantasy world where magic permeates everyday life, from the age-old nation of Wong, bountiful in magic and energy resources and steeped in old traditions, to the floating city of Agnesa, a land filled with resourceful Alchemists who had revolutionized the world with its magic-infused equipment, vehicles, and weaponry. The magic energy flowing in this world is able to collect and form into two embodiments: the Shimmering Flower (幻光花), which grows in waves in the fields of Wong, and the Saffrea gem (莎华宝石) used as currency in the greater parts of the world. 
The hierarchy of the world is divided into three sects: the Chosen, humans who are highly receptive to the magical energies of the world and possess their own special brand of magical powers; the Fanatics, humans who are not receptive to magic but use the Saffrea to bestow upon them their powers; and the powerless, some of whom instead choose to divert their resourcefulness to become Alchemists, humans who dabble in the art of infusing magic to machinery.
In the current trajectory of the world, the continent of Varlhun has been split into four nations: Wong, the origin of it all; Agnesa, a nation built by Alchemists exiled from Wong; Fersares, a former colony of Agnesa, and Tarpaz, a democratic nation built by emigrants from Wong. Agnesa and Fersares are experiencing a detente coming down from the conclusion of the recent Agnesa-Fersares war, only stopped due to a disastrous explosion of magical energy eight years ago in one of Agnesa’s fort strongholds, Fort Arcadina. The result of this explosion is a space-time distortion in the surrounding area, creating an area that seems to be perpetually enveloped in darkness and that has become teeming with unknown monsters. To combat this, the nation of Fersares has set up a number of Guilds, the growth of which is unprecedented and that has now established bases in the other nations of Agnesa and Wong. Meanwhile, the looming energy shortage in Agnesa and the avarice of power in Tarpaz bring a foreboding to the stability of the continent…
The story follows closely six perspectives: Vyrut Chrono, the young commander of a special secret Tarpazian squad, Shun Oldwin, the Crown Prince of Wong who seeks answers to events that had led to his sister Miyo’s amnesia, Rhea Turner and Yuno Asker, two Agnesian heirs who seek answers to the downfall of their close relatives in Fort Arcadina, Gloria Vella and Emon J, two Fersarian mercenaries, and Gian Lannal, a Tarpazian exchange student to Wong who’s managed to embroil himself in the tangle of stories.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School Life', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']",https://www.novelupdates.com/series/song-of-time-dusk-awakening-verse/

The Legend of Eternal Life,"There are untold secrets and mysteries in this world. As time passes and species evolve, many DNA mutations happen within the environment, creating four new species: Yiwo, Xiuman, Bisite, and Keyou.

Yiwo can change elements, Xiuman controls mechanical objects, Bisite organizes evolution, and Keyou controls necromancy, so the four groups have distinctly different lives. While every species has supernatural powers, they cannot stop aging or dying, and even the Keyou cannot indefinitely extend life. The Yiwo has a lifespan of ninety years, the Xiuman eighty years, the Bisite lives to be fifty years due to their ferocious fighting, and the Keyou average 120 years.
